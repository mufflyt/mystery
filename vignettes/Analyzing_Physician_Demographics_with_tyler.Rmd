## Introduction

The `tyler` package provides tools for health services researchers to analyze physician demographics, specialties, and practice locations using public data sources. This vignette demonstrates a complete workflow for:

1. Finding and validating physician NPI numbers
2. Retrieving detailed physician information from multiple data sources 
3. Analyzing practice settings and locations
4. Enriching the data with demographic information

## Setup

```r
library(tyler)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
```

## Example Dataset: ACOG Presidents

For this demonstration, we'll analyze the demographics and practice characteristics of ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) presidents. The package includes this dataset:

```r
data(acog_presidents)
head(acog_presidents)
```

## 1. Finding NPI Numbers

The first step is finding NPI numbers for our physicians:

```r
# Prepare input data
input_presidents <- acog_presidents %>%
  filter(!is.na(first) & !is.na(last)) %>%
  select(first, last)

# Search NPPES Registry
npi_results <- phase0_search_batch_npi(
  name_data = input_presidents,
  max_results = 3
)
```

### Filtering for Specialists

We can filter the results to only include OBGYNs using taxonomy codes:

```r
# Get OBGYN taxonomy codes
obgyn_taxonomy_codes <- taxonomy %>%
  filter(str_detect(Classification, regex("Obstetrics|Gynecology", ignore_case = TRUE))) %>%
  select(Code, Specialization)

# Filter NPI results 
npi_results_obgyn <- npi_results %>%
  filter(taxonomies_code %in% obgyn_taxonomy_codes$Code) %>%
  distinct(npi, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

## 2. Retrieving Detailed Provider Data 

Next, we'll query the National Downloadable File for comprehensive provider information:

```r
NDF_data <- phase0_national_downloadable_file(
  npi_numbers = npi_results_obgyn$npi,
  batch_size = 10,
  user_agent = "Researcher Name <email@institution.edu>"
)
```

## 3. Enriching with Demographics

The package provides functions to add demographic information:

```r
# Add predicted gender based on first names
enriched_data <- phase0_genderize_physicians(
  physician_data = NDF_data,
  first_name_column = "NDF_first",
  last_name_column = "NDF_last"
)

# Classify practice settings
enriched_data <- phase0_create_academic_column(
  enriched_data, 
  address_columns = c("NDF_addresses_address_1")
)
```

## 4. Geocoding Practice Locations

For spatial analysis, we can geocode practice addresses:

```r
# Requires Google Maps API key
geocoded_data <- phase0_geocode(
  address_table = enriched_data,
  api_key = Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"),
  address_column_names = c(
    "addresses_address_1", "addresses_city", 
    "addresses_state", "addresses_postal_code"
  )
)
```

## Output Data Structure

The final dataset includes rich physician information:

- **Demographics**: Gender, estimated age range
- **Credentials**: MD/DO status, specialties, board certifications  
- **Practice**: Academic vs private setting, location details
- **Geographic**: Coordinates, rurality indicators
- **Medicare/Medicaid**: Program participation, expansion state status

## Best Practices

1. Always provide a descriptive user agent when querying APIs
2. Handle rate limits appropriately (built into package functions)
3. Validate NPI numbers before detailed lookups
4. Consider privacy implications when working with provider data
5. Document data sources and timestamps in your analysis

## Detailed Data Source Information

### NPPES Registry

The National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) is the authoritative registry for National Provider Identifier (NPI) numbers in the United States. 

#### NPPES Data Structure
- **NPI Types**: 
  - Type 1: Individual providers
  - Type 2: Organizational providers
- **Core Data Elements**:
  - Basic demographics (name, gender)
  - Practice locations
  - Taxonomy codes (specialties)
  - Contact information

#### API Query Details
The `phase0_search_batch_npi()` function constructs API queries like:
```r
# Example API endpoint structure
https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api/?version=2.1
  &first_name=JANE
  &last_name=DOE
  &limit=1
  &skip=0
```

### National Downloadable File (NDF)

The CMS National Downloadable File provides comprehensive Medicare provider data, updated quarterly.

#### NDF Data Structure
The file contains multiple related tables:

1. **Basic Provider Information**
   - NPI
   - Name and credentials
   - Primary specialty
   - Gender
   - Medical school

2. **Practice Locations**
   - Multiple addresses per provider
   - Practice type indicators
   - Medicare enrollment status

3. **Group Affiliations**
   - Organization relationships
   - Group practice indicators

4. **Medicare Program Information**
   - Participation status
   - Assignment indicators
   - EHR program participation

#### Query Process
The `phase0_national_downloadable_file()` function:

1. **Authentication and Setup**
   ```r
   # Function requires a user agent for tracking
   user_agent <- httr::user_agent(user_agent_string)
   
   # Configures API connection
   base_url <- "https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1/datastore/sql"
   ```

2. **Query Construction**
   ```r
   # Example query structure
   query <- sprintf(
     "SELECT * FROM provider_data WHERE npi IN (%s) AND type = 'individual'",
     paste(npi_numbers, collapse = ",")
   )
   ```

#### Rate Limiting and Quotas

- **NPPES**: 
  - 20 requests per second
  - No daily limit
  - IP-based rate limiting

- **NDF**: 
  - 5,000 requests per hour
  - Token-based authentication
  - Requires user agent identification

The package automatically handles these limits with exponential backoff and request batching.
