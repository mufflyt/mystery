\title{Generate Wait Time Statistics and Summary Sentences with Logging and Error Handling}
\usage{
results_section_wait_time_median_stats(
  appointment_data,
  wait_time_col = "business_days_until_appointment",
  group_var = NULL,
  round_digits = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{appointment_data}{A data frame containing appointment wait time data.}

\item{wait_time_col}{Character string; the name of the column representing wait time in business days.}

\item{group_var}{Character string; the name of the column to group by for grouped statistics (e.g., "Subspecialty").
If NULL, only overall statistics are calculated.}

\item{round_digits}{Integer; number of decimal places to round Q1 and Q3 values.}
}
\value{
A list containing two tibbles:
\describe{
\item{stat_summary}{A tibble with calculated statistics for median wait time, Q1, Q3, and Group.}
\item{sentence_summary}{A tibble with summary sentences for each group.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the median wait time, 25th percentile (Q1), and 75th percentile (Q3)
for the \code{business_days_until_appointment} column both overall and grouped by a specified variable.
It logs each step to the console and includes error handling to ensure robustness.
