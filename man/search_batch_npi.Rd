\usage{
search_batch_npi(df, limit = 5, write_csv_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe with two columns: \code{first} (first names) and \code{last} (last names).}

\item{limit}{The number of results to request for each query (default is 5).}

\item{write_csv_path}{A character string specifying the file path to save the results as a CSV file. If NULL, no CSV is saved. (default is NULL).}
}
\value{
A flattened dataframe with NPI results, including custom columns tracking the
first and last names that were searched, with an option to save the results as a CSV file.

\description{
This function performs a batch search for first and last names using the NPI registry API
and returns a flattened dataframe with relevant results. Optionally, it saves the results as a CSV file.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Basic batch NPI search with two names
df <- data.frame(
  first = c("Tyler", "Matthew"),
  last = c("Muffly", "Muffly")
)
npi_results <- search_batch_npi(df, limit = 5)

# Example 2: Batch NPI search with different name combinations
df <- data.frame(
  first = c("John", "Jane"),
  last = c("Smith", "Doe")
)
npi_results <- search_batch_npi(df, limit = 10)

# Example 3: Batch NPI search with more names and a CSV output
df <- data.frame(
  first = c("Anna", "Tom", "Emily"),
  last = c("Brown", "White", "Black")
)
npi_results <- search_batch_npi(df, limit = 15, write_csv_path = "npi_results.csv")
}
