\title{Results Section: Medicaid Summary with Logging and Error Handling}
\usage{
results_section_medicaid_summary(
  significant_predictors,
  medicaid_acceptance_rate,
  accepted_medicaid_count,
  total_medicaid_physicians_count
)
}
\arguments{
\item{significant_predictors}{A data frame containing significant predictor variables, their directions, and formatted p-values.
It should have columns: "Variable", "Direction", and "Formatted_P_Value".}

\item{medicaid_acceptance_rate}{A numeric value representing the Medicaid acceptance rate (in percentage).}

\item{accepted_medicaid_count}{An integer representing the count of physicians accepting Medicaid.}

\item{total_medicaid_physicians_count}{An integer representing the total count of physicians considered for Medicaid.}
}
\value{
A character string representing the summary sentence.
}
\description{
This function generates a summary sentence for the results section based on significant predictor variables and Medicaid acceptance rates.
It logs the process, performs error checking, and includes default behavior for robust execution.

\examples{
# Example 1: Basic usage with two significant predictors
significant_vars <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Specialty", "Region"),
  Direction = c("positively associated", "negatively associated"),
  Formatted_P_Value = c("<0.01", "0.02")
)
results_section_medicaid_summary(significant_vars, 45.6, 100, 200)
# Output: Physicians who accepted Medicaid were Specialty positively associated (p = <0.01) and Region negatively associated (p = 0.02). The Medicaid acceptance rate was 45.6\% (n = 100/N = 200).

# Example 2: Using larger physician counts and different acceptance rate
significant_vars <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Experience", "Training Level"),
  Direction = c("positively associated", "negatively associated"),
  Formatted_P_Value = c("<0.05", "0.01")
)
results_section_medicaid_summary(significant_vars, 35.2, 500, 1200)
# Output: Physicians who accepted Medicaid were Experience positively associated (p = <0.05) and Training Level negatively associated (p = 0.01). The Medicaid acceptance rate was 35.2\% (n = 500/N = 1,200).

# Example 3: Using a single significant predictor and a high acceptance rate
significant_vars <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Age"),
  Direction = c("positively associated"),
  Formatted_P_Value = c("<0.001")
)
results_section_medicaid_summary(significant_vars, 60.0, 750, 1250)
# Output: Physicians who accepted Medicaid were Age positively associated (p = <0.001). The Medicaid acceptance rate was 60.0\% (n = 750/N = 1,250).
