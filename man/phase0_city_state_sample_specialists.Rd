\item{data}{A dataframe containing specialist information. It must have columns: \code{city}, \code{state_code}, \code{specialty_primary}, and \code{phone_number}.}

\item{generalist}{A character string specifying the generalist specialty to sample. Default is "General Dermatology".}

\item{specialist1}{A character string specifying the first specialist specialty to sample. Default is "Pediatric Dermatology".}

\item{general_sample_size}{An integer specifying how many generalists to sample for each city-state combination. Default is 4.}

\item{specialist1_sample_size}{An integer specifying how many of the first specialists to sample for each city-state combination. Default is 1.}

\item{specialist2}{A character string specifying a second specialist specialty to sample. Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{specialist2_sample_size}{An integer specifying how many of the second specialists to sample. Default is 0.}

\item{specialist3}{A character string specifying a third specialist specialty to sample. Optional. Default is NULL.}

\item{specialist3_sample_size}{An integer specifying how many of the third specialists to sample. Default is 0.}

\item{same_phone_number}{A logical value indicating whether to sample generalists and specialists with the same phone number (TRUE) or different phone numbers (FALSE). Default is TRUE.}

\item{output_csv_path}{A character string specifying the path to save the output CSV. If not provided, the result will only be returned.}
