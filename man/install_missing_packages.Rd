\title{Install Missing CRAN Packages with Version Reporting}
\usage{
install_missing_packages(cran_pkgs)
}
\arguments{
\item{cran_pkgs}{A character vector containing the names of CRAN packages to verify and install if missing.
Each element should be the name of a package available on CRAN.}
}
\description{
This function checks for the presence of specified CRAN packages on the user's system.
If a package is not already installed, it automatically installs it with all dependencies.
For packages that are already installed, the function logs their version numbers to the console.
}
\details{
This utility function is designed to ensure that necessary CRAN packages are installed for a project.
It uses \code{\link[utils]{installed.packages}} to check for existing packages and \code{\link[utils]{install.packages}}
to install any missing packages. For already-installed packages, the function retrieves and displays the version
number from the installed package metadata.

The function automatically handles package dependencies during installation by passing \code{dependencies = TRUE}
to \code{install.packages}.
}
\note{
This function requires an active internet connection to download and install packages from CRAN.
Ensure that your R environment has write permissions to the library path.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example 1: Ensure ggplot2 and dplyr are installed
install_missing_packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))

# Example 2: Install a set of commonly used packages for data wrangling and visualization
install_missing_packages(c("tidyr", "readr", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))

# Example 3: Check for and install machine learning packages
install_missing_packages(c("caret", "randomForest", "xgboost"))

# Example 4: Use this function to ensure all required packages for a project are installed
required_packages <- c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "readr", "caret", "randomForest")
