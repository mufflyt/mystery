\title{Create a Forest Plot for Significant Predictors with Logging}
\usage{
create_forest_plot(df, target_variable, significant_vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the dataset used for the regression analysis.}

\item{target_variable}{A string representing the target variable (dependent variable) for the regression model.}

\item{significant_vars}{A data frame containing significant predictors with their variable names (\code{Variable}),
coefficients (\code{Coefficient}), and confidence intervals (\code{Lower_CI}, \code{Upper_CI}).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the forest plot with coefficients and confidence intervals for each significant predictor.
}
\description{
This function generates a forest plot displaying significant predictors' coefficients and confidence intervals
for a Poisson regression model. It logs each step of the process, providing insights into the predictors included,
coefficients, and confidence intervals. The forest plot highlights the direction and significance of effects
for the analyzed variables.
}
\details{
The function loops through significant predictors to fit individual Poisson regression models for each predictor
against the target variable. It extracts coefficients and confidence intervals, compiles the results, and visualizes
them as a forest plot. A vertical dashed red line at \code{x = 0} indicates no effect.
