}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing professional information. Must include at least the columns \code{city}, \code{state_code}, and \code{specialty_primary}.}

\item{generalist}{A character string specifying the specialty name for generalists. Default is \code{"Generalist"}.}

\item{specialty}{A character string specifying the specialty name for specialists. Default is \code{"Specialist"}.}

\item{case_names}{A character vector of case names to assign. Default is \code{c("Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma")}.}

\item{output_csv_path}{A character string specifying the file path to save the output CSV. Default is \code{"output/city_state_assign_scenarios.csv"}.}

\item{seed}{An optional integer value to set the random seed for reproducibility. Default is \code{NULL} (no seed set).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the assigned cases.
}
\description{
The \code{phase0_city_state_assign_scenarios} function is designed to assign cases to professionals based on their
\strong{specialty} and \strong{location} (city and state). This function is particularly useful for managing scenarios where
professionals, such as physicians or other healthcare workers, need to be assigned cases for administrative or analytical purposes.
}
\details{
\subsection{\strong{Key Features of the Function}:}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Generalists vs. Specialists}: The function differentiates between generalists and specialists, assigning cases accordingly.
\item \strong{CSV Output}: The final output, including case assignments for each professional, is saved to a CSV file using the \code{write_output_csv} function.
}
}

\subsection{\strong{Use Cases}:}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Healthcare Assignment}: Assigning different types of cases to healthcare professionals based on their specialties and the cities/states where they practice.
\item \strong{Research Studies}: Managing scenarios in research studies where professionals need to be randomly assigned to cases.
