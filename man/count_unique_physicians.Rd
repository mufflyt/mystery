\title{Count Unique Physicians Based on Insurance Type and Exclusion Reason}
\usage{
count_unique_physicians(
  df,
  insurance_type,
  reason_for_exclusion = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing physician data. Must include columns 'insurance', 'reason_for_exclusions',
'business_days_until_appointment', and 'phone'.}

\item{insurance_type}{A string specifying the insurance type to filter by (e.g., "Medicaid").}

\item{reason_for_exclusion}{A string specifying the reason for exclusion to filter by. Default is NULL,
which includes all rows regardless of the exclusion reason.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean indicating whether to print detailed logs. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
An integer representing the number of unique physicians who meet the specified criteria.
}
\description{
This function filters a dataframe of physician data based on insurance type, reason for exclusion,
and appointment availability, then counts the number of unique physicians who meet the criteria.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Counting unique physicians with specific insurance type and reason for exclusion
df <- data.frame(
  insurance = c("Medicaid", "Medicaid", "Blue Cross/Blue Shield", "Medicaid"),
  reason_for_exclusions = c("Able to contact", "Not available", "Able to contact", "Able to contact"),
  business_days_until_appointment = c(5, 0, 10, 3),
  phone = c("123-456-7890", "123-456-7890", "098-765-4321", "234-567-8901")
)
unique_count <- count_unique_physicians(df, insurance_type = "Medicaid", reason_for_exclusion = "Able to contact")
print(unique_count)  # Expected output: 1

# Example 2: Counting unique physicians without specifying a reason for exclusion
df2 <- data.frame(
  insurance = c("Blue Cross/Blue Shield", "Blue Cross/Blue Shield", "Medicaid"),
  reason_for_exclusions = c("Able to contact", "Not available", "Able to contact"),
  business_days_until_appointment = c(3, 5, 1),
  phone = c("321-654-0987", "321-654-0987", "654-321-0987")
)
unique_count2 <- count_unique_physicians(df2, insurance_type = "Blue Cross/Blue Shield")
print(unique_count2)  # Expected output: 1

# Example 3: Using verbose logging to see detailed steps
df3 <- data.frame(
  insurance = c("Medicaid", "Medicaid", "Medicaid", "Medicaid"),
  reason_for_exclusions = c("Able to contact", "Able to contact", "Not available", "Able to contact"),
  business_days_until_appointment = c(2, 1, 0, 4),
  phone = c("111-222-3333", "111-222-3333", "222-333-4444", "333-444-5555")
)
unique_count3 <- count_unique_physicians(df3, insurance_type = "Medicaid", verbose = TRUE)
print(unique_count3)  # Expected output: 2
